No one will probably ever visit this website except for me.  But I already know everything about myself, so there is nothing else I need to really say!

Well, despite nobody hearing this I'll atleast say a few words just to listen for the echo in the void.  Also, for the sake of my future self who may have forgotten who I was before I'll remind you.


Dear Shawn,

Given that only you will come across this, I'll share some things which you may have forgotten or have chosen to forget, including some of your deepest darkest secrets.  But in the small chance that someone else may stumble upon this I've decided to encrypt the rest of this document with your [public key]({% link _pages/shadow.md %}).
