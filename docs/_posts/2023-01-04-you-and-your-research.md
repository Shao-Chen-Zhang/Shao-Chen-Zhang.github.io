[Hamming, "You and Your Research" (June 6, 1995)][youtube-link]

I recently stumbled upon this lecture by Richard Hamming, one of the early pioneers in computer science.  Hamming is well-known for developing error correction methods used in computer networks, but in this lecture titled "You and Your Research," Hamming speaks more broadly on the topics of science and how success is achieved in any academic field.

There are many insightful moments throughout the lecture, so it's well worth the watch.  But here I will summarize of the points made by Hamming that really stood out to me.

> "I've noticed very clearly at Bell Laboratories, those who work with the door shut may be working just as hard ten years later but they don't know what to work on.  They are not connected to reality.  Those who had the door open may very well know what's important." ([18:34][timestamp-18:34])

Earlier on in the lecture Hamming dismisses the misconception that luck and intelligence are the defining factors that lead to success, and here he makes the brilliant point that it doesn't matter how smart you are if you are always working on the wrong problem.

> "The guys with the door closed were often very well able, very gifted but they seemed to work always on slightly the wrong problem." ([19:08][timestamp-19:08])

In a field as broad as computer science, it's easy to get distracted by all sorts of new and interesting topics. Especially when you are new to the field, the tree of computer science seems to be one with an endless amount of leaves, and depending on our method of traversal we may ultimately find ourselves lost within its thickets.  Even within the subdomain of cybersecurity, there are a myriad of different subjects and career paths to choose from.  From topics such as threat intelligence, malware analysis, penetration testing, digital forensics, incident response and others, it can be difficult to select an area to focus on.  Hamming offers some advice of this exact topic.

> "I spent ten percent of my time trying to answer the question, 'what are the important problems in my field?' Ten percent.  Friday afternoon straight-through." ([29:25][timestamp-29:25])

Here, Hamming recommends regularly asking ourselves what are the important problems in our field.  He illustrates that it's not all about hard work, but that academic success requires working on the right problem, in the right way, at the right time.  But this idea extends beyond academia, evident in the adoption of cloud technologies and artificial intelligence which demonstrate how steady development can culminate to a crescendo of rapid progress in the industry.  If only we had the foresight to see the importance of these problems as they developed then we could contribute to that new frontier of technology and become a pioneer in something truly important.  Yet, new technology itself is of no importance if it does not become adopted.  An area often overlook within computer science is communication. 

> "You need to learn to communicate orally in talks like this, written in written reports and casual conversations.  In the middle of a conference you have to be able to get up to say, 'that's wrong for these reason, bing, bing, bing, bing!' And you win.  If you sit around and say, 'well, I'll write a report tomorrow after I've thought about it some more," the decision is made we go ahead and it doesn't matter what you do then." ([34:46][timestamp-34:46])

We've all sat through lectures where no one wants to speak up, or ask questions, especially in computer science courses.  There appears to be the misconception in fields such as computer science that technical ability is all that matters.  However, Hamming gives the example of special relativity where Henri Poincar√© had all the same pieces as Albert Einstein did yet it was only the latter that could present the concept in a well-defined manner.
