[Hamming, "You and Your Research" (June 6, 1995)][youtube-link]

I recently stumbled upon this lecture by Richard Hamming, one of the early pioneers in computer science.  Hamming is well-known for developing error correction methods used in computer networks, but in this lecture titled "You and Your Research," Hamming speaks more broadly on the topics of science and how success is achieved in any academic field.

There are many insightful moments throughout the lecture, so it's well worth the watch.  But here I will summarize of the points made by Hamming that really stood out to me.

> "I've noticed very clearly at Bell Laboratories, those who work with the door shut may be working just as hard ten years later but they don't know what to work on.  They are not connected to reality.  Those who had the door open may very well know what's important." ([18:34][timestamp-18:34])

Earlier on in the lecture Hamming dismisses the misconception that luck and intelligence are the defining factors that lead to success, and here he makes the brilliant point that it doesn't matter how smart you are if you are always working on the wrong problem.

> "The guys with the door closed were often very well able, very gifted but they seemed to work always on slightly the wrong problem." ([19:08][timestamp-19:08])

In a field as broad as computer science, it's easy to get distracted by all sorts of new and interesting topics. Especially when you are new to the field, the tree of computer science seems to be one with an endless amount of leaves, and depending on our method of traversal we may ultimately find ourselves lost within its thickets.  Even within the subdomain of cybersecurity, there are a myriad of different subjects and career paths to choose from.  From topics such as threat intelligence, malware analysis, penetration testing, digital forensics, incident response and others, it can be difficult to select an area to focus on.  Hamming offers some advice of this exact topic.

> "I spent ten percent of my time trying to answer the question, 'what are the important problems in my field?' Ten percent.  Friday afternoon straight-through." ([29:25][timestamp-29:25])

Here, Hamming recommends regularly asking ourselves what are the important problems in our field.  He illustrates that it's not all about hard work, but that academic success requires working on the right problem, in the right way, at the right time.
